    <p1>Hello, my name is <b>Darshil Dilipkumar Prajapati</b>. I am pursuing engineering in <strong>Artificial Intelligence  </strong>.
I come from a supportive family. My father is a farmer and my mother is a homemaker.
<i>I am a hardworking and curious person who enjoys learning new skills and technology</i>.
My goal is to build a successful career and support my family.</p1>

<p2><u>My family's annual income is approximately seventy thousand rupees.</u>
My father is the main earning member of our family and he works as a farmer.
<s>Our income mainly depends on seasonal agricultural work, so it is not fixed and can vary each year.</s>
My mother is a homemaker and supports the family at home.
</p2>

<p3>My role model is my father. He works as a farmer and has always worked very hard to support our family.
<sub>Despite financial challenges, he never gave up and always encouraged me to focus on education and discipline.</sub>
His honesty, dedication, and positive attitude inspire me to work hard and stay motivated toward my goals.
<sup>I want to make him proud by building a successful career.</sup></p3>

<p4>If I am awarded this scholarship, I will use it to support my education expenses such as college fees, books, and learning resources.
It will also help me enroll in skill development courses related to technology and improve my practical knowledge.
<ins>This financial support will reduce the burden on my family and allow me to focus more on my studies and career goals.</ins>
<mark>I am very grateful for this opportunity and will use it responsibly.</mark></p4>
